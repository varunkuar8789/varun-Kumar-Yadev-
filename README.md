To build your island and nurture your tribes in your unique islands, you need to bring out your uniqueness. This is more to do with the experience that you give to your students. Everything, right from your design, your branding, your branding, the look and feel of it, how people feel when they come into your world, how people think when they come into your webinars, how you nurture your community, what kind of support system you give them. How simple you make it for them to learn and grow.https://www.facebook.com/Freedom-Cariyar-Growth-ILH-102084831953405/
